We've been having so much fun inside Castaways.Club that I forgot to write a newsletter or record another episode of the podcast talking about it.

## How It's Been Going So Far

I deliberately chose to have the Patreon campaign show the number of Patrons / members so anyone can see at a glance how things are going. I hate clubs / private communities that show staged or stock photos of everyone having a good time inside.

Ahem.

Some other numbers:

* 263 posts
* 47 topics
* Averaging 5 daily users

And here's a quick screenshot of the discussions happening as of today:

## Coming Up!

Now that we've got the initial kinks worked out and folks are in the forum and Discord, I've got plans to start some audio challenges for folks who want an extra creative push in their podcasting journey - the results of which will appear on the podcast in some form.

<hr>

## Interested?

First - check it out here at [patreon.com/goodstuff](https://www.patreon.com/goodstuff).

You'll notice that there's a "Founding Member" option for the first 20 people to sign up priced at $7/month vs the regular monthly pricing of $10/month - 7 of those options available!

I set it up this way both to reward early adopters who want to sign up but also because the folks who sign up first are going to help do a bit more work as we figure out how Castaways Club is going to function.

When you sign up you should get notified of details on how to join the Discord as well as the forum - but if all the hooks and gizmos don't connect properly, please get in touch with me! Depending on the time of day I may not respond instantly - but I will get you connected and into the forums/Discord!

I can't wait to see you all on the inside!

I'm going to keep the rest of the email more or less the same each time so that everyone can see and be reminded of what I'm hoping this podcasting community can become:

* A virtual coffee shop to talk with other podcasters at various stages of their hobby/career in podcasting.
* A safe place to throw out ideas, rough drafts, weird experiments, or be vulnerable about frustrations and hurts along the road and receive encouragement, feedback, and possibly partners to try things with.
* Where you'll get the push and motivation to not only start a podcast, but also to keep it going when you feel like nobody else is paying attention.
* It won't be free to join. There needs to be some cost to signing up to prevent leeches from abusing the community.

In the next email, I'll talk about the actual fee we'll be charging for membership to cover the costs of running this thing successfully.
